# Building Workflows

In Data-River, building workflows is all about connecting visual blocks to define the flow of data and actions. Whether you're automating a business process or creating a simple logic flow, Data-River makes it easy with a drag-and-drop interface.

This guide introduces the key concepts of building workflows using the basic blocks—Start, Input, Output, and End. Each block has a specific role in your workflow, and by connecting them, you can create a powerful automation system.

## Key Blocks for Building Workflows

When starting out with Data-River, you'll primarily work with these four blocks:

### 1. [**Start Block**](guides/building-workflows/start.md)

The Start Block is essential for every workflow. It initiates the flow and signals the beginning of the process.

- **Purpose**: Initializes the workflow.
- **Example**: Starting a workflow, that fetches pokemon information.

### 2. [**Input Block**](guides/building-workflows/input.md)

The Input Block is used to collect data that will be processed in your workflow. This could be user input, API data, or information from another service.

- **Purpose**: Collect data for use in the workflow.
- **Example**: Providing an pokemon name to a workflow that fetches the pokemon's information.

### 3. [**Output Block**](guides/building-workflows/output.md)

The Output Block is where the results of the workflow are displayed or passed to another system.

- **Purpose**: Displays or outputs the results of the workflow.
- **Example**: Outputting a pokemon's information to the user.

### 4. [**End Block**](guides/building-workflows/end.md)

The End Block marks the conclusion of your workflow. Once this block is reached, the workflow is complete, and no further actions will be taken.

- **Purpose**: Signals the end of the workflow.
- **Example**: Finalizing workflow execution and displaying the results.

## How to Build a Workflow

Building a workflow in Data-River is simple:

1. **Drag and Drop**: Select blocks from the block library and drop them onto the canvas.
2. **Connect**: Link the blocks by dragging from the output of one block to the input of another.
3. **Configure**: Customize the blocks by setting input values, defining outputs, and configuring any necessary parameters.
4. **Test and Run**: Once your workflow is set up, run it to see it in action.

For example, to build a simple workflow that collects a user’s name and outputs a greeting:

1. Start with a **Start Block**.
2. Add an **Input Block** to enter pokemon name.
3. Connect the **Output Block** to display the pokemon information.
4. Finish with an **End Block** to complete the flow.

## Best Practices for Building Workflows

- **Start Small**: Begin with a basic workflow using the Start, Input, Output, and End blocks. Once you're comfortable, you can add more complexity.
- **Organize Your Workflow**: Keep your workflows tidy by arranging blocks logically.
- **Test Frequently**: Test each block as you go to ensure everything is working as expected before adding more steps.
