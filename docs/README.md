# Welcome to Data-River ðŸŒŠ

Data-River is an open-source platform designed to empower everyoneâ€”from kids to professionalsâ€”to code and automate visually. While weâ€™re just getting started, we already have a basic engine running in the browser, with a few foundational blocks in place.

**Currently, you can experiment with 4 basic blocks: Start, Input, Output, and End**â€”the building blocks of workflows. And this is just the beginning! As we develop further, Data-River will evolve into a fully flexible, visual platform for all kinds of automation and coding tasks.

## Why Data-River?

### A Platform for All Ages and Skill Levels

**Data-River** is designed to be flexible and adaptive:

- **For Kids**: Start with visual blocks that teach programming basics, inspired by tools like Scratch. They can create simple logic and experiment with coding concepts by connecting our starter blocks.
- **For Business Professionals**: Automate processes like email workflows, approval chains, and API integrations using a drag-and-drop interfaceâ€”no need to touch code.
- **For Developers**: We currently have JavaScript-based blocks, and our execution engine is up and running in the browser, allowing you to build and run workflows directly in a modern browser.

## Current Features

- **Visual Block Editor**: Create workflows by connecting visual blocks. Our available blocksâ€”Start, Input, Output, and Endâ€”allow you to start building basic flows.
- **Browser-Based Execution**: The engine currently runs directly in the browser, making it easy to test and build workflows locally.
- **Stateful Execution**: Weâ€™re working towards supporting long-running processes and server-side workflows.
- **JavaScript-Based Blocks**: Build workflows using JavaScript, with plans to support additional languages like Python in the future.

## Who Is Data-River For?

- **Kids & Educators**: Introduce coding through visual tools and workflows.
- **Businesses**: Automate processes quickly without writing a single line of code.
- **Developers**: Build and test custom workflows with our existing blocks, running in your browser.
