# Suggest Blocks

Have an idea for a new block? Weâ€™d love to hear it! As Data-River grows, the variety of blocks that users can drag and drop into their workflows is essential to making the platform more powerful.

## How to Suggest Blocks

1. **Join Our Discord**:  
   Head over to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/CmEqvZQUQn) and share your idea in the "feature-requests" channel.

2. **Open a GitHub Issue**:  
   Alternatively, you can open an issue on the [Data-River GitHub repository](https://github.com/softflow24/data-river) with your suggestion. Make sure to include details such as:
   - What the block should do.
   - Example use cases.
   - Inputs and outputs the block might handle.

## Criteria for Block Suggestions

When suggesting a block, consider the following:

- **Functionality**: What specific action does the block perform? (e.g., fetch data from an API, perform a calculation, etc.)
- **Simplicity**: Can the block be easily understood and used by a wide range of users?
- **Scalability**: How can this block fit into more complex workflows?
