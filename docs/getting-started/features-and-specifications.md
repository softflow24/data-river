# Features and Specifications

Data-River is an open-source framework that empowers users to visually create and automate workflows. Whether you're a beginner or an advanced developer, Data-River adapts to your needs. Here's a breakdown of the current features and specifications.

## Key Features

### 1. **Visual Block Editor**

- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Build workflows by connecting visual blocks, such as Start, Input, Output, and End.
- **Customizable**: Blocks are JavaScript-based, making it easy for developers to create custom logic and nodes.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Perfect for kids and non-developers looking to learn programming through visual tools.

### 2. **Browser-Based Execution**

- **Run Locally**: Data-River's execution engine currently runs directly in modern browsers, allowing you to test and run workflows without needing any server setup.
- **No Server Required**: Simple workflows can be executed without additional infrastructure, making it highly accessible for early-stage experimentation.

### 3. **Stateful Execution**

- **Server-Side Logic**: For more complex workflows, stateful execution will soon be available, allowing for long-running processes and deeper integrations with server-side operations.
- **Language Flexibility**: While our default blocks are in JavaScript, we're working on supporting other languages like Python for server-side blocks.

### 4. **Modular and Extendable**

- **Reusable Components**: Build from a library of pre-built blocks or create your own custom blocks. Share them in the upcoming marketplace.
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend the functionality of Data-River with custom plugins and integrations.

### 5. **Asynchronous Processing**

- **Seamless API Calls**: Easily integrate asynchronous operations like API requests, ensuring that workflows can handle multiple tasks without blocking execution.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Monitor inputs and outputs for each block in real-time to debug and optimize your workflows.

### 6. **Scheduled Workflows**

- **Task Automation**: Use scheduling features to automate tasks, such as sending notifications or triggering API calls at specific times.
- **Built-in Scheduler**: Thanks to Temporal, Data-River will support robust scheduling out of the box.

## Future Specifications

### 1. **AI-Ready Workflows**

- **Generative AI Support**: Data-River will support AI blocks to easily integrate models like OpenAI, Hugging Face, and local LLMs.
- **AI Automation**: Automate tasks like chatbot workflows or data classification by adding AI to the mix.

### 2. **Marketplace for Blocks**

- **Block Sharing**: A marketplace where users can buy, sell, or share pre-built blocks, allowing for quick customization of workflows.
- **Community Contributions**: Developers can contribute to the marketplace by creating and submitting new blocks for others to use.

### 3. **Multi-Platform Accessibility**

- **Cross-Platform**: Data-River will eventually support running workflows across various platforms, from browsers to servers, ensuring flexibility for developers.
- **Mobile Support**: Build and execute workflows on mobile devices, allowing for easy automation on the go.
