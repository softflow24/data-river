        <p className="mb-4">
          We may offer a free trial period, as specified within the Platform.
          During this time, services are provided "as is," without guarantees or
          protections. To continue accessing premium services after the trial,
          you must pay applicable fees. All prices listed exclude taxes, which

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Subscriptions</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Subscriptions are billed on a monthly or yearly basis. After the
          initial term, subscriptions will automatically renew for the same
          duration unless you cancel or modify your subscription before the
          renewal date. You are responsible for ensuring that your payment
          information is current and accurate. If you do not wish to renew your
          subscription, you must contact us via email at support@data-river.app

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Payment</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Subscription fees for monthly plans are due in advance at the start of
          each month. You may cancel a monthly plan anytime, retaining access
          until the end of the billing cycle. Annual plans require
          non-refundable, upfront payments and grant access for a 12-month
          period.
          <p className="mb-4">
            Payments for these products are not handled directly by the Site but
            are instead processed through a secure third-party payment
            processor. The payment processor is solely responsible for managing
            all aspects of the payment process, including any issues related to
            payment processing. Any disputes, questions, or issues regarding
            payments should first be addressed directly with the payment
            processor. For all other payment-related inquiries, you must contact
            us directly. Once we receive confirmation from the payment processor
            that a payment has been successfully made and has passed all fraud
            checks, access to the purchased product or service will be granted
            as soon as possible. However, we do not guarantee the exact timing
            of access and are not liable for any delays.

          Upgrades and downgrades
        </h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Where you upgrade or downgrade the services you can access on our
          Platform and you are on a monthly plan, we will amend your fees
          payable on the next billing cycle. Where you are on an annual plan,
          you must pay for these in advance prior to the upgrade taking place.
          Please note that you will only be able to downgrade monthly services
          and by downgrading your services it may cause you to lose features
          and/ or data. We will in no way be liable for this.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          If you exceed the limits of your current plan, certain features or
          functionalities may become unavailable. It is your responsibility to
          monitor your plan usage, which can be tracked at any time in your user
          profile. Once the plan limits are exceeded, you will not regain access
          to those features until the next billing cycle begins or you choose to
          upgrade to a higher plan. We are not liable for any inconvenience or
          disruption caused by exceeding your plan limits, and it is up to you
          to ensure your usage stays within the allocated thresholds.

        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">What is data-river?</h3>
        <p className="mb-4">
          The Data-River platform enables users to automate workflows across
          various software applications and services. It includes tools,
          documentation, and related services that facilitate these automations.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">
          Content of the platform
        </h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Data-River is an open-source platform designed to streamline task
          automation and workflow creation for users of all skill levels. It
          provides a visual and code-integrated environment to design
          workflows—sequences of automated tasks that interact across
          applications or systems based on specific triggers and logic.
        </p>

        <p className="mb-4">The platform introduces several core components:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-4 mb-6">
          <li>
            <strong>Workflows:</strong> These are the backbone of Data-River,
            allowing users to automate complex processes by connecting modular
            building blocks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Lake:</strong> A centralized repository for
            community-contributed workflows and blocks, where users can
            discover, share, and collaborate on solutions to common automation
            challenges.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Blocks:</strong> Modular units within workflows that
            represent specific actions, such as data input, processing, or API
            calls. Blocks can be configured and combined to create powerful
            automations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Marketplace:</strong> A curated space for sharing and
            accessing both community-created and official blocks, enabling users
            to extend the platform's capabilities with minimal effort.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p className="mb-4">
          Data-River empowers users by combining visual simplicity with
          technical flexibility, creating a platform that adapts to diverse
          needs—from individual experimentation to enterprise-level automation.
